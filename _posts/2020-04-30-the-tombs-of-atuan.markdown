The second book in Le Guin’s Earthsea series, _The Tombs of Atuan_ is a fascinating counterpoint to _A Wizard of Earthsea_.  Where the first book is about journeying to the ends of the Earth, _Atuan_ is about being trapped inside it.  The first book is a coming-of-age tale of a young man embracing his own shadow.  _Atuan_ is the story of a young woman escaping from a societal shadow larger than herself, and reclaiming her own individual identity.  Where _A Wizard of Earthsea_ is all exhilarating adventure and the open sea, this book is almost oppressively dark and confined.  I love them both.

_The Tombs of Atuan_ is a story about the Kargish people – pale-skinned warriors from the desert islands of the east.  They are the same people who attack Ged’s village in the beginning of _A Wizard of Earthsea_.  Essentially they're Eathsea’s vikings: the fearsome outsiders and barbarians who have a different culture and way of life from the rest of the Archipelago.  Atuan is one of their islands, on which a sect of women clerics and eunuchs worship the Kargish gods, the Nameless Ones, unseen entities which live in the darkness of the Tombs.  Here, once again, Le Guin’s anthropological imagination shines.  She tells a story which is totally limited to one location and only a few characters, but packs a lot of depth and complexity into how she slowly reveals Kargish society.  Le Guin plays with sociological themes like religious conviction, gender roles, cultural norms, and the idea of the “other.”  

A recent retrospective piece on [Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/2020/04/29/the-tombs-of-atuan-power-ideology-and-becoming-uneaten/) by Gary K. Wolfe celebrated _The Tombs of Atuan_ and its heritage as a relative early entrant of feminist literature into fantasy and science-fiction.  Wolfe points out that Atuan repeatedly examines the illusory nature of power.  There is a complicated calculus of power symbolically given and received by characters in Atuan, and in the end the whole power structure collapses once Tenar decides to abandon her people’s ideology.  These kinds of themes would later become much stronger and more blatant in Le Guin’s writing – so much so that, in my opinion, it hurts the storytelling quality of some of the other Earthsea books like _Tehanu_.  However, in _Atuan_, the ideas are handled with quite a light hand and are given a fascinating intensity by the symbols attached to them.  The Nameless Ones.  The dark Tombs.  A girl reclaiming her own name.  Luckily, the story stands on its own.

_A Wizard of Earthsea_ and _The Tombs of Atuan_ are a one-two punch of storytelling and “worldbuilding” prowess.  It’s as if Le Guin set herself a challenge to, when writing the sequel, entirely flip the script so that she couldn’t rely on reusing the work she had done in the first book.  _Atuan_ brings the reader a new society, a new perspective, a new type of story, and a new type of hero.  In the end she reconciles the two opposite narratives by bringing Ged and Tenar together – two very different halves making a stronger whole, a theme which would be continued in her later Earthsea novels.  Man and woman, light and dark, discovery and escape.
