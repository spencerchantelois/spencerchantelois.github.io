## Ingredients

- 3 1/3 cups All-Purpose Baking Mix (see Game Plan note)
- 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts
- 1/2 cup currants
- 2 cups beer (any pale lager such as Corona, Budweiser, or Heineken)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for cooking
- Butter and maple syrup, for serving




## Method

1.	Combine baking mix, nuts, and currants in a large bowl and mix until evenly combined. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the beer, eggs, and vegetable oil. Stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just moistened. (Donâ€™t overmix or the pancakes will be tough. The batter should be lumpy.)
2.	Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat on a camping stove or over a campfire fitted with a grilling grate. Test to see if the pan is hot enough by sprinkling a couple of drops of cold water in it: If the water bounces and sputters, the pan is ready to use; if it evaporates instantly, the pan is too hot.
3.	Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into the pan for each pancake. (You should be able to fit 3 to 4 pancakes at a time.) Cook until pancakes rise slightly and form lots of bubbles on top, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until bottoms are golden brown, about another minute.
4.	Repeat with remaining batter, adding 1 tablespoon oil between batches if the pan seems dry. Serve immediately with butter and maple syrup.
