## Ingredients

- 2 x 410g cans apricots, drained
- 600g jar apricot compote (we used Bonne Maman)
- 200g plain flour
- 140g almond, with skins, chopped
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 200g butter, diced
- 100g caster sugar
- 100g demerara sugar
- vanilla ice cream or crème fraîche, to serve



## Method

1.	Mix the apricots and compote together in a big baking dish or 6-8 individual dishes. Mix the flour, nuts and cinnamon, then rub in the butter to form crumbs. Stir in the sugars, then sprinkle over the apricot mixture. You can now cover and leave this for up to 24 hrs.
2.	Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 (or turn down the oven once the pie comes out). Bake for 40-45 mins until the crumble is crisp and golden, then serve with ice cream or crème fraîche.




- Serves: 6-8
- Preparation time: 20 minutes, 45 minutes to cook
