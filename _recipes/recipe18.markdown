## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more, to taste
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 pound red potatoes, cut into 8 long wedges
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives




## Method

1.	Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
2.	In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, to taste.
3.	Place potato wedges onto prepared baking sheet and fold up all 4 sides of the foil. Spoon the olive oil mixture over the potatoes. Fold the sides of the foil over the potato wedges, covering completely and sealing the packet closed.
4.	Place into oven and bake until tender, about 30-35 minutes.* Sprinkle with cheese; then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the potatoes are crisp.
5.	Serve immediately, garnished with sour cream and chives, if desired.
