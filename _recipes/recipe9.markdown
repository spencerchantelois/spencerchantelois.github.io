## Ingredients

- 50g light soft cheese
- squeeze lemon juice
- 1 hot-smoked salmon fillet
- 1 heaped tsp capers
- a little lemon zest
- 1 baking potato
- Oil



## Method

1.	Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Rub a little oil and seasoning over the potatoes, then bake on a baking sheet for 25 mins. Turn down the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and bake for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins more until the flesh is tender and the skin crisp and golden. For a quicker option, prick a potato with a fork. Wrap in a sheet of kitchen paper and microwave on High for 8-10 mins until soft inside. For crisp skin, rub with a little oil, then flash under a hot grill, turning often. To serve, slice a cross in the centre, squeeze the base to ‘pop’ the top, then choose your favourite filling.
2.	For the salmon and soft cheese filling, mix 50g light soft cheese with a squeeze lemon juice and seasoning. Pile into a jacket potato and flake 1 hot-smoked salmon fillet on top. Sprinkle with 1 heaped tsp capers and a little lemon zest.
