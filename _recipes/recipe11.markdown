## Ingredients

- 8 Italian sausage links
- 4 bell peppers, thinly sliced
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil, divided kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish




## Method

1.	Heat grill to high. Cut 4 sheets of foil about 12" long.
2.	Grill sausages until charred, 3 minutes per side, then divide among foil. Top with peppers and onions and drizzle each with 1 tablespoon olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.
3.	Fold foil packets crosswise over the sausage and peppers mixture to completely cover the food. Roll top and bottom edges to seal closed.
4.	Grill until peppers and onions are tender and sausage is cooked, 13 to 15 minutes.
5.	Garnish with parsley and serve.
