## Ingredients

- 1 yellow pepper, deseeded and cut into chunks
- 1 courgette, thickly sliced
- 1 red onion, cut into wedges
- 225g self-raising flour
- 2 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tsp
- 5 tbsp fresh tomato pasta sauce
- 50g cheddar, grated




## Method

1.	Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Place the pepper, courgette and red onion on a large non-stick baking tray and drizzle with 1 tsp olive oil. Season well and toss to combine. Roast in the oven for 20 mins until soft and beginning to brown. Set aside.
2.	Heat the grill to medium. Season the flour well and, in a large bowl, mix with the remaining oil and 4-5 tbsp water to form a soft dough. Knead briefly, then roll out on a floured surface to a rough 20cm circle. Transfer the dough to a large ovenproof, non-stick frying pan and fry over a medium heat for 5 mins, until the underside begins to brown. Turn over and cook for a further 5 mins. Spread the tomato sauce over the base, scatter with the roasted veg, then sprinkle with cheddar. Grill the pizza for 3-4 mins until cheese has melted. Serve immediately, sliced into wedges, with a large green salad.
