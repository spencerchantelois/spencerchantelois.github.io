## Ingredients

- up to 6 tbsp sunflower oil
- 4kg stewing beef
- 4 white onions, sliced
- 4 tbsp chipotle paste
- 8 garlic cloves, crushed
- 50g ginger, grated
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tbsp plain flour
- 2l beef stock
- 3 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 5 x 400g cans pinto or kidney beans, drained



## Method

1.	Heat a small drizzle of the oil in an extra-large flameproof dish. Brown the meat in batches, adding a drop more oil, remove from the dish and set aside. Add 1 tbsp oil to the dish, then the onions, and cook for 7-10 mins or until caramelised.
2.	Stir the chipotle paste, garlic, ginger, cumin, cinnamon and flour in with the onions and cook for a couple of mins. Gradually add the stock, stirring all the time, so itâ€™s fully mixed in with the other ingredients. Add the tomatoes and oregano, season and simmer for 10 mins.
3.	Now tip in the beef, cover and simmer very gently for about 1 hr 45 mins until tender, removing the lid and adding the beans for the final 15 mins. If the sauce is thin, let it boil down for a further 5-10 mins with the lid off. Before serving, adjust the seasoning. Serve with the garlic bread and salsa.
