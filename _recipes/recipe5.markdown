# Cheesy asparagus foil packs

This a fresher take on our famous cheesy baked asparagus. Feel free to sub in any melty cheese for the mozzarella — fontina or Gruyère would be delicious, too.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. asparagus, stalks trimmed
- 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- Red pepper flakes, for garnish
- Kosher salt
- 2 c. shredded mozzarella
- Grated parmesan, for garnish




## Method

1.	In a large bowl, toss together asparagus, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, and oregano. Season with salt and red pepper flakes.
2.	Lay out four pieces of foil. Divide asparagus between foil, then sprinkle mozzarella into the center of each. Fold foil to seal packs.
3.	Heat grill to medium-high. Grill packs until asparagus is tender and mozzarella has melted, about 15 minutes.
4.	Garnish with more red pepper flakes and Parmesan, if using.
